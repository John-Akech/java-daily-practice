# Java Daily Practice

Welcome to my Java Daily Practice repo! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently learning Java and have decided to push my progress here every day.  
This repository includes small coding exercises, problem-solving tasks, and practice projects â€” all written in Java.

## Goals:
- Practice Java daily
- Improve my problem-solving skills
- Track my learning progress over time

Feel free to explore the code, give feedback, or join me on this journey!
